# redwood_kids_playground

[Redwood](https://www.redwoodliteracy.com) is a school in Chicago whose purpose is to help students with dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, or executive functioning needs. 

As part of their curriculum, they will be learning about coding and vehicles, and what a better way to do that than coming to BMW and talking directly to our engineers.

This app is just a simple example for the kids to change a few parameters, such as the color of the car, the sound, or make it move. The goal is to help them realize that coding is just "how to talk to computers", and that anyone can do it.
